Data collection: The first step will be to collect historical temperature data. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, government agencies, or online databases.
Data preparation: The next step will be to prepare the data for modeling. This may involve cleaning the data, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a format that is compatible with the ARIMA model.
Model selection: The third step will be to select an ARIMA model. There are a variety of ARIMA models available, and the best model for a particular dataset will depend on the characteristics of the data.
Model fitting: The fourth step will be to fit the ARIMA model to the data. This involves estimating the parameters of the model using the historical data.
Forecasting: Once the model is fitted, it can be used to generate forecasts for future temperatures.
Evaluation: The final step will be to evaluate the forecasts. The accuracy of the forecasts can be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as the mean squared error (MSE).
